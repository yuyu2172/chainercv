class SequentialFeatureExtractor(chainer.Chain):

    """A feature extractor model with a single-stream forward pass.

    This class is a base class that can be used for an implementation of
    a feature extractor model.
    Callable objects, such as :class:`chainer.Link` and
    :class:`chainer.Function`, can be registered to this chain with
    :meth:`init_scope`.
    This chain keeps the order of registerations and :meth:`__call__`
    executes callables in that order.
    A :class:`chainer.Link` object in the sequence will be added as
    a child link of this link.

    :meth:`__call__` returns single or multiple features that are picked up
    through a stream of computation.
    These features can be specified by :obj:`feature_names`, which contains
    the names of the features that are collected.
    When :obj:`feature_names` is a string, single feature is returned.
    When :obj:`feature_names` is an iterable of strings, a tuple of features
    is returned. The order of the features is the same as the order of
    the strings in :obj:`feature_names`.
    When :obj:`feature_names` is :obj:`None`, the last feature is returned.

    Examples:

        >>> import chainer.functions as F
        >>> import chainer.links as L
        >>> model = SequentialFeatureExtractor()
        >>> with model.init_scope():
        >>>     model.l1 = L.Linear(None, 1000)
        >>>     model.l1_relu = F.relu
        >>>     model.l2 = L.Linear(None, 1000)
        >>>     model.l2_relu = F.relu
        >>>     model.l3 = L.Linear(None, 10)
        >>> # This is feature l3
        >>> feat3 = model(x)
        >>> # The features to be collected can be changed.
        >>> model.feature_names = ('l2_relu', 'l1_relu')
        >>> # These are features l2_relu and l1_relu.
        >>> feat2, feat1 = model(x)

    Params:
        feature_names (string or iterable of strings):
            Names of features that are collected during
            the forward pass.
